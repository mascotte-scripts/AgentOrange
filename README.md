# IMPORTANT NOTICE
Under no circumstance should this resource ever be ran on a live public server. Doing so will allow absolutely anyone to be able to execute unsecured events on your server. The injector simulator should only ever be ran on a private development server that cannot be publicly accessed. This resource was created to help server owners & developers identify vulnerable events that can be easily exploited by modders using LUA injectors or test anti-cheat resources in a safe enviroment without the risk of being banned globally from FiveM - however careless use of this resource could potentially cause you more harm than good.  

# [WIP] Mascottes Injection Simulator
A FiveM resource that simulates a LUA injector but within the enviroment of a resource. Useful for testing how secure your events are from LUA injection and for  improving the general security of your resources.
