# IMPORTANT NOTICE
**Under no circumstance should this resource ever be ran on a live public server. Doing so will allow absolutely anyone to be able to execute unsecured events on your server.** 

Agent Orange should only ever be ran on a private development server that cannot be publicly accessed. This resource was created to help server owners & developers identify vulnerable events that can be easily exploited by modders using LUA injectors and for those looking for a way to test the efficiency of anti-cheat resources in a safe enviroment without the risk of being banned globally from FiveM/RedM

**Careless use of this resource could potentially cause you more harm than good**
